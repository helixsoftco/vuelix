# Vue 3 + Typescript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and Typescript in Vite.

## Features

### üöÄ Vue 3 + Vite 2

The version 3 of Vue with its powerful **Composition API** is available in this project,
along with the new `<script setup>` SFCs syntax.

Vite is the lightning Fast Next Generation Frontend Tooling that highly improves the development experience along with
all the community-created plugins.

> _NOTE:_ The initial state of this project was generated using Vite oficial scaffolding: `npm init vite@latest`

See:

- [Vue 3 Docs](https://v3.vuejs.org)
- [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup)
- [Vite Docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html)

### ‚öôÔ∏è TypeScript and SCSS

TypeScript and SCSS languages are supported and strongly recommended.

See:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)

### üóÇ File system routing

Routes for `vue-router` will be auto-generated from Vue files in the `src/pages` using the file structure.

See:

- [vite-plugin-pages](https://github.com/hannoeru/vite-plugin-pages)

### üìë Layouts system

Vue components in the `src/layouts` dir as used as layouts.
By default, `default.vue` will be used unless an alternative is specified in the route meta.

You can specify the layout in the page's SFCs like this:

```vue
<route lang="yaml">
meta:
  layout: home
</route>
```

See:

- [vite-plugin-vue-layouts](https://github.com/JohnCampionJr/vite-plugin-vue-layouts)
- [vite-plugin-pages](https://github.com/hannoeru/vite-plugin-pages)

### üîó Path Aliasing

`@/` is aliased to the `./src/` folder.

For example, instead of having

```ts
import HelloWorld from '../../../components/HelloWorld.vue'
```

you can use

```ts
import HelloWorld from '@/components/HelloWorld.vue'
```

### ‚ú® Routes Transitions

Route changes are animated. By default, the `fade` transition will be used unless an alternative is specified in the route meta.

The `fade` and `slide-fade` transitions are available.
You can specify the transition in the page's SFCs like this:

```vue
<route lang="yaml">
meta:
  transition: slide-fade
</route>
```

> _NOTE:_ Transitions are not triggered between routes of the same type, therefore changing the parameters of the active route won't cause a route transition. This could be changed by using the `route.fullPath` instead of `route.name` as the key in [RouterViewTransition.vue](./src/components/RouterViewTransition.vue). More info: https://stackoverflow.com/a/70042452/4873750.

> Route transitions can be deactivated by changing the provided `enable-route-transitions` value in [main.ts](./src/main.ts).

See:

- [RouterViewTransition.vue](./src/components/RouterViewTransition.vue)

### ü™Ñ Eslint + Prettier

This project comes with the recommended Eslint configuration for Vue 3 plus integration with Prettier.
Prettier helps formatting code while Eslint helps catching bugs in development.

When opening the project in VSCode, it will ask the developers to install Eslint and Prettier, because that way
the VSCode [settings.json](.vscode/settings.json) will work and therefore both Prettier and Eslint fix will be
executed when saving a file.

Aditionally, commands to lint, check and autoformat code are available in the scripts of [package.json](./package.json)

See:

- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison.html)
- [eslint-plugin-vue](https://eslint.vuejs.org/)
- [eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier)
- [vue-eslint-parser](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-eslint-parser)

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar) + [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) + [Eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

## Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports, they are shimmed to be a generic Vue component type by default. In most cases this is fine if you don't really care about component prop types outside of templates. However, if you wish to get actual prop types in `.vue` imports (for example to get props validation when using manual `h(...)` calls), you can enable Volar's `.vue` type support plugin by running `Volar: Switch TS Plugin on/off` from VSCode command palette.
